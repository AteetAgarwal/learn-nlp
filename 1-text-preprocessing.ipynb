    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a comprehensive text preprocessing workflow for NLP tasks using the IMDB dataset of 50k movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Performed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading & Exploration** - Load CSV dataset and examine structure\n",
    "2. **Lowercasing** - Convert all text to lowercase for consistency\n",
    "3. **HTML Tag Removal** - Strip HTML tags from reviews\n",
    "4. **URL Removal** - Remove HTTP/HTTPS and www URLs\n",
    "5. **Punctuation Removal** - Eliminate punctuation marks (with performance comparison)\n",
    "6. **Slang Conversion** - Convert chat abbreviations to full words using dictionary\n",
    "7. **Spell Correction** - Fix misspelled words using TextBlob\n",
    "8. **Stopword Removal** - Remove common English stopwords\n",
    "9. **Emoji Handling** - Remove or demojize emojis\n",
    "10. **Tokenization** - Split text into words/sentences using multiple methods:\n",
    "    - String split\n",
    "    - Regular expressions\n",
    "    - NLTK\n",
    "    - Spacy\n",
    "11. **Stemming** - Reduce words to root form using Porter Stemmer\n",
    "12. **Lemmatization** - Convert words to base dictionary form"
